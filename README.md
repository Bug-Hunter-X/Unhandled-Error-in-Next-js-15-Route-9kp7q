# Unhandled Error in Next.js 15 Route

This example demonstrates an unhandled error in a Next.js 15 application and provides a solution for gracefully handling such errors.  The original `about.js` throws an error, causing the application to crash. The solution implements error boundaries to catch and display a custom error message, providing a better user experience.
